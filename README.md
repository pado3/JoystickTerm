AV controller via Wi-Fi and BLE with Arduino and ESP32-WROOM-32E

This is a hybrid Wi-Fi and BLE remote control for playing web videos on Raspberry Pi5.
Access to the Raspberry Pi5's power remote control and web applications for controlling TVs and other peripherals is via Wi-Fi, and playback is via BLE after the Raspberry Pi5 is booted.
